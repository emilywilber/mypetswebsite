        My family got Paco about eight years ago and he<tag>&#8217;</tag>s around 13 years old. We found him on Craigslist where his previous family was moving and didn<tag>&#8217;</tag>t want him anymore so my mother had to save him. He<tag>&#8217;</tag>s clinically overweight and not that smart but we love him anyway. We often refer to him as our <tag>&quot;</tag>broken old man<tag>&quot;</tag> due to his messed up tailbone that makes him sit funny and hop up stairs with his back legs together. <a href="https://www.pets4homes.co.uk/pet-advice/tail-injuries-in-cats.html">Here</a> is a website about broken cats like Paco.

          Cooper is our dog who we rescued from the <a href="https://www.greenvillecounty.org/acs/AdoptablePets.aspx?PetType=Dog">Greenville Pound</a> two years ago. My mother doesn<tag>&#8217;</tag>t like dogs so it took my dad years to convince her but now we all love him. His favorite things to do are eat the cat<tag>&#8217;</tag>s food, dig holes in the yard, and bork at friends and family.

            <h3>Finn</h3>

          <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
              <li>Fish</li>
              <li>It's a fish</li>
              <li>Red</li>
              <li>Fish don't really do that much...</li>
          </ul>
          Finn is our fish and the least important member of our family. We got Finn at <a href="https://www.petsmart.com/">Petsmart</a> a little over a year ago. He is my brother<tag>&#8217;</tag>s fish and I rarely see or care about him. Finn is short for Phineas which was most probably inspired by Phineas and Ferb. I think it<tag>&#8217;</tag>s pretty silly to keep a fish as a pet as it doesn<tag>&#8217;</tag>t even know you exist if it<tag>&#8217;</tag>s not actively staring at you. But I don<tag>&#8217;</tag>t pick favorites, I swear.
